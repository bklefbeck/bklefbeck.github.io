        <p2>BYU-Idaho is the place where i have worked for actual pay in tech support and IT and have learned the most for sure. I started at the Tier 2 IT Support on campus in october of 2024 and still currently working there with a lot of great technicians. I have truly enjoyed my time and am really happy with the progress ive made as well as the opportunities that will most likely come from here.</p2>
