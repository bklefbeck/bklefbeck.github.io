      <h2 class="home-title">Why Employ Me?</h2>
      <h4>This Website is just as useful for me as it is for anyone else as any future employers will be able to access this website as a means to gain information. It will be for them know if i am qualified to be hired or what i will be able to bring to use to their company. Obviously this is something only i can offer them, there is not another place that will have the information about me if im not writing it myself. I will gladly be able to update this as time goes on and i get more and more experience in my field and with more opportunities as i see fitting. 

This website will answer questions such as “why is he someone i want to hire?” or “What makes him different from anyone else i would want to hire?”. I will show my certified accomplishments as well as provide past employments that can show exactly what i have done and how i have helped these places with what i want to do. I hope that these will help those who look to this website to find out more information about me and allow me to provide additional sources to make myself a better option.

I have been super interested in tech support and computers ever since i was younger. I assembled and used my first desktop computer my freshman year of high school and loved the experience as well as the amount of work that goes into troubleshooting and getting things to work when they do not. I found it to be very fulfilling and worth the headache it can be sometimes.
